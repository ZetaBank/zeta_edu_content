    - The code you provided contains an indentation error. Indentation in Python is important for defining which blocks of code belong to a particular statement (such as an if statement). The correct code should be:

    .. code-block:: python

        money = True
        if money:
            print("Taxi")
            print("Ride")
            print("Go")

    - In this modified code, if the money variable is True, “Taxi”, “Ride”, and “Go” are output.
