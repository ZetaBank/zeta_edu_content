Building ROS Development Environment
================

Here's how to install ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04:

1. Set Up Your Sources List:

-   Open a terminal window and add the ROS repository to your sources list:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

2. Set Up Your Keys:

    - You need to add the ROS key to ensure the packages are authentic:

    .. code-block:: bash
        
        sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://ha.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654

3. Update Package Index:

    - Update the package index to make the ROS packages available:

    .. code-block:: bash
        
        sudo apt update

4. Install ROS Melodic:

    - Install the ROS desktop-full package. This package includes ROS, rqt, rviz, robot-generic libraries, 2D/3D simulators, navigation, and perception:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full

5. Initialize rosdep:

    - Before you can use ROS, you need to initialize rosdep. rosdep enables you to easily install system dependencies for ROS packages.

    .. code-block:: bash
        
        sudo rosdep init
        rosdep update

6. Environment Setup:

    - To automatically add ROS environment variables to your bash session every time a new shell is launched, add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:

    .. code-block:: bash

        echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
        source ~/.bashrc

7. Dependencies for Building Packages:

    - To install the dependencies required to build ROS packages, run:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt install python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential

- Now, you have successfully installed ROS Melodic on your Ubuntu 18.04 system. You can create a ROS workspace and start working on your robotic projects.

- Remember to consult the official ROS Melodic installation guide for any updates or additional information.
